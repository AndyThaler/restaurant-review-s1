# Restaurant Review App - Stage 1
---
#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

In the first stage of the Restaurant Review App, it was necessary to fix and upgrade a bugged website to be responsive on every kind of device-screen, as well as fixing the possibility for people that use e.g. screenreaders to access the page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisities

- Clone the repository into your wished location with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndyThaler/restaurant-review-s1
```
 - Download and Install  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. And dont forget to **check the checkbox for adding python to the PATH**, when you install it.



## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>`(in js files) with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
